"Final report for the PBL4 course on Computer System Specialization"

Objective: 

- Improve Python skills in image processing.

- Build a fingerprint recognition model using the convolutional neural network (CNN) method.
 
- Utilize fingerprint scanning modules to capture real-life fingerprints to enhance visualization in image processing.

Results:

- Utilized Python with supported image processing frameworks to apply in preprocessing steps before the model proceeds to using convolutional neural network layers.
- 
- Completed the project "Fingerprint recognition using convolutional neural network".
